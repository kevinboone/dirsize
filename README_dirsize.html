dirsize is a simple utility that totals the sizes of files in a particular
directory. Unlike the standard <code>du</code>, it is not concerned with 
working out the total disk space usage, but the actual size of the file
contents. dirsize will always report a smaller figure than <code>du</code>,
because it will ignore the storage of inodes, etc. More importantly,
dirsize should give the same results when applied to the same files
on different systems. This can not be said for <code>du</code>, because
the overheads involved in maintaining the directory structure are
system-dependent.
<p/>
The main intended application of dirsize is to act as a quick check that
directory trees have been copied correctly from one system to another using,
e.g., <code>rsync</code>. <code>du</code> is often unhelpful here, because
it is not expected to report exactly the same total size on different
filesystems.
